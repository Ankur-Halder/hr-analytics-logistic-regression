# 🧠 HR Analytics - Logistic Regression Model

This repository contains a Logistic Regression-based machine learning model built using an HR dataset. The objective of this project is to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `HR_comma_sep.csv`
- **Source:** Internal HR data (anonymized)
- **Features:**
  - `satisfaction_level`
  - `last_evaluation`
  - `number_project`
  - `average_montly_hours`
  - `time_spend_company`
  - `Work_accident`
  - `promotion_last_5years`
  - `sales` (department)
  - `salary`
  - `left` (target variable)
